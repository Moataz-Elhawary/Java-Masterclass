You'll be using an endless loop which:
Prompts the user to enter a number or any character to quit.
Validates if the user-entered data really is a number.
You can choose either an integer or double validation method.

If the user-entered data is not a number, quit the loop.
Keep track of the minimum number entered.
Keep track of the maximum number entered.
If the user has previously entered a set of numbers (or even just one),
display the minimum and maximum number that the user entered.
