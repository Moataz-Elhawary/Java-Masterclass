Your challenge is to create the Worker class,
the Employee class, and either the SalariedEmployee or the HourlyEmployee class.

- A salaried employee is paid based on some percentage of his or her annual salary.
If this person is retired, then the salary may be 100 percent of this amount,
but it is generally reduced somewhat.

- An hourly employee is paid by the hours worked and the hourly rate they agreed to work for.
An hourly employee may also get double pay if they work over a certain number of hours.


For each class, create the attributes and methods shown on this diagram.

Create a main method that will create either a SalariedEmployee or HourlyEmployee,
and call the methods, getAge, collectPay,
and the method shown for the specific type of class you decide to implement.
